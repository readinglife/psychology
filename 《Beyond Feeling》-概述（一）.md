## PART ONE THE Context

> Anyone who wish to master an activity must first understand its tools and rules.   ...  In critical thinking, however, the tools are not material objects but concepts, and the rules govern mental rather than physical performance.<br>The first section explore seven important concepts - individuality, critical thinking, truth, knowledge, opinion, evidence, and argument - with a chapter devoted to each.

掌握一件事物就必须知道其规则和使用这个事物的工具，如何进行批判性思维也是这样，,但是，这些工具不是实质性的对象而是概念，并且规则支配着心理而非身体的表现。接下来作者给出了7个重要概念，这些概念可能你非常熟悉，但是作者给出了三个你必须要重新审视这些词的理由：

> First, much of what is commonly believed about these concepts is mistaken.<br>Second, who ever examines them carefully is always rewarded with fresh insights.<br>Third, the more thorough your knowledge of these concepts, the moreproficient you will be in your thinking.

然后作者直接来了一个灵魂拷问`Who are you?`你可能直接会回答你的名字。但是怎样详细描述你自己的呢？那就要从身体(`physical`)，情感(`emotional`)以及智力(`intellectual`)各个方面来描绘你这个人。

### The Influence of Time and Place

作者认为`time`和`place`这两个因素刻画了一个人的全貌。在同一个时间，不同的大洲的人对一样的事物就会有不同的看法，另外一个人在同样的地点，如果发生在现代和发生在中世纪那么对同样的法规那就不同的看法。最后作者下了一个结论

> To sum up, living in a different age or culture would make you a different person. Even if you rebelled against the values of your time and place, they still would represent the context of your life—in other words, they still would influence your responses.

### The Influence of Ideas

> When one idea is expressed, closely related ideas are simultaneously conveyed, logically and inescapably. In logic, this kinship is expressed by the term *sequitur,* Latin for “it follows.” (The converse is *non sequitur,*“it does not follow.”)

当一个`idea`被表述出来的时候，每一个人听到这个`idea`的时候就会有不同的想法，对`idea`就会有不同的解读，有人停留在其表面意思(`face value`)，也有人对其进行深层次的解读(`implication`)。当然对于不同的领域，不同职业的人对同一个`idea`也会有不同的解读，在听到大家的解读之后，说出这个`idea`的人对也会受到这些人想法的影响(` our actions are shaped by those meanings and implications, whether we are aware of them or not`)。

> For example, the idea that there is no real difference between virtue and vice implies that people should not feel bound by common moral standards. Samuel Johnson had this implication in mind when he said: “But if he does really think that there is no distinction between virtue and vice, why, Sir, when he leaves our houses let us count our spoons.” 

> **If we were fully aware of the closely linked meanings and implications of the ideas we encounter, we could easily sort out the sound ones from the unsound, the wise from the foolish, and the helpful from the harmful. But we are seldom fully aware. In many cases, we take ideas at face value and embrace them with little or no thought of their associated meanings and implications. In the course of time, our actions are shaped by those meanings and implications, whether we are aware of them or not**

> The innumerable ideas you have encountered will affect your beliefs and behavior in similar ways––sometimes slightly, at other times profoundly. And this can happen even if you have not consciously embraced the ideas.

### The Influence of Mass Culture

> In centuries past, family and teachers were the dominant, and sometimes the only, influence on children. Today, however, the influence exerted by mass culture (the broadcast media, newspapers, magazines, Internet and popular music) often is greater.

大众媒体(`mass culture`)通过影视，报纸，网络以及互联网等渠道影响着我们的思想，提倡消费主义。同时电视剧通过频繁的`scene shifts`比如一些血腥暴力的画面来吸引着我们观看，在观看的过程中还插播一些广告，这些都极大的降低了一个人的注意力时间(`attention span`)。这会导致人们的持续注意力时间会下降，很难长时间关注某件事或阅读某个文章，这也是为什么目前短视频以及各种短文章流行。这些流行也和目前提倡的碎片化阅读有关。这些快消文化的流行，也导致了人们不愿意深入思考，只停留在一个`idea`的`face value`。

> Because such people seldom have the patience to read books that require them to think, many publishers have replaced serious books with light fare written by celebrities.

一些新闻媒体为了获得曝光度和流量，常常会抛弃一些不痛不痒的答案(`banlanced answer`)，而是提出一些极端的观点，更多是具有主观性，而没有反映客观事实。

>News is now becoming more opinion than verified fact. Journalists are slipping into entertainment rather than telling us the verified facts we need to know.

如今的政客也是善于操作民众的高手，先广泛征集民意，然后根据民意来制定自己的政治主见，以获得民意支持。

> They even go so far as to test the impact of certain words—that is  why we hear so much about “trust,” “family,” “character,” and “values”  these days. 

扩展阅读：

- `attention span:`

  Attention span” refers to the amount of time a person can concentrate focused attention on something. 

### The "Science" of Manipulation

阅读这一段，带来了一系列的思考：什么是正确的？你为什么认为他正确？你喜欢的这些东西是不是别人通过潜移默化传递给你的？

> Less well known is Watson’s application of behaviorist principles to advertising. He spent the latter part of his career working for advertising agencies and soon recognized that the most effective appeal to consumers was not to the mind but to the emotions. He advised advertisers to “tell [the consumer] something that will tie him up with fear, something that will stir up a mild rage, that will call out an affectionate or love response, or strike at a deep psychological or habit need.

作者在这一段介绍了广告商可以通过媒体来操纵人们的想法。广告商通过一系列的策略能让消费者以为他是自己发自内心的喜欢某个东西，其实这有可能是某个广告商想要他喜欢的某个东西。这些策略起作用的原因有很多种，但是最主要的原因就是：他们不相信他们会被操纵。

> The strategies work for a number of reasons, the chief one being people’s conviction that they are impervious to manipulation.

但是还是证明人的记忆是可以被操纵的，甚至可以在某个人的记忆中创造本没有发生的记忆。

> research has shown that human memory can be manipulated. The way a question is asked can change the details in a person’s memory and even make a person *remember something that never happened*!

广告商甚至不满足于激发消费者的情绪或者往人们心中植入消费的想法，他们还试图通过一次又一次地重复这些印象来增强这些印象。 人们听到的口号或谈话要点越多，就越熟悉。 不久之后，**它就与通过认真思考而形成的思想变得难以区分。**

**你所以为的正确的，其实是广告商让你以为正确的。**

> Many of the beliefs we hold dearest and defend most vigorously may have been planted in our minds in just this way

最后用作者的一段话作为结尾

>Many years ago, Harry A. Overstreet noted that “a climate of opinion, like a physical climate, is so pervasive a thing that those who live within it and know no other take it for granted.”20 The rise of mass culture and the sophisticated use of manipulation have made this insight more relevant today than ever.

### The Influence of Psychology

在一个社会思想体系中中，不同的指导思想就会产生不同的社会形态，对应到个人，那就是一个人的**价值观**。不同的价值观就会产生对事物不同的态度(`attitude`)，信念(`belief`)

作者举例，在美国过去的几十年

>  Before the past few decades, people were urged to be self-disciplined, self-critical, and self-effacing. They were urged to practice self-denial, to aspire to self-knowledge, to behave in a manner that ensured they maintained self-respect. Self-centeredness was considered a vice

老一辈就会以这个为教条来教导下一代，给年轻人灌输他们**所谓的正确的价值观**。

> By and large, our grandparents internalized those teachings. When they honored them in their behavior, they felt proud; when they dishonored them, they felt ashamed.

但是在美国当代，目前的主流价值观与几十年前相比发生了巨大的变化

>  Self-esteem, which nineteenth-century satirist Ambrose Bierce defined as “an erroneous appraisement,” is now considered an imperative. Self-centeredness has been transformed from vice into virtue, and people who devote their lives to helping others, people once considered heroic and saintlike, are now said to be afflicted with “a disease to please.”

当`self-esteem`成为主流价值观时，当代美国人就将这个作为教条，教导下一代美国人。

>  so most contemporary Americans have internalized the message of self-esteem. We hear people speak of it over coffee; we hear it endlessly invoked on talk shows. Challenges to its precepts are usually met with disapproval.

但是目前的对`self-esteem`的理解就一定是对的吗？

> isn’t the theory of self-esteem self-evident? No

（美国）人们通常会认为那些学习成绩不好的人，不能很好的完成工作任务的人缺少自尊心。但是事实上，可能是**一些消极的认知**影响着我们平常的表现

> Reasoning that it was their defeatist attitude rather than any lack of ability that was undermining their efforts, the educator set out to change their self-images. He found that when he accomplished that, *they no longer behaved stupidly*! Maltz concludes from this and other examples that our experiences can work a kind of self-hypnotism on us, suggesting a conclusion about ourselves and then urging us to make it come true.

总之，无论何种心理学学说，都对我们的`attitudes`,`values`以及`beliefs`产生了巨大的影响。

> All of us would have been affected—we can only imagine how profoundly—in our attitudes, values, and beliefs.

Note：

- 对于某个时代的文化，放在当时那个时间可能就是正确的，对于某些文化放在当时那个时代是错误的，但是放在以后那可能就是正确的。
- 对于主流文化也有可能是幕后者所操纵的。
