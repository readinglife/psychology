## Becoming an Individual

In light of what we have discussed, we should regard individuality not as something we are born with but rather as something acquired—or, more precisely, *earned.* Individuality begins in the realization that it is impossible to escape being influenced by other people and by circumstance. The essence of individuality is vigilance. The following guidelines will help you achieve this:

1. *Treat your first reaction to any person, issue, or situation as tentative.* No matter how appealing it may be, refuse to embrace it until you have examined it.
2. *Decide why you reacted as you did.* Consider whether you borrowed the reaction from someone else—a parent or friend, perhaps, or a celebrity or fictional character on television. If possible, determine what specific experiences conditioned you to react this way
3. *Think of other possible reactions you might have had to the person, issue, or* *situation.*
4. *Ask yourself whether one of the other reactions is more appropriate than* your first reaction.* And when you answer, resist the influence of your conditioning.

To ensure that you will really be an individual and not merely claim to be one, apply these guidelines throughout your work in this book, as well as in your everyday life.
